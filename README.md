## Tawnamy Bot

This is an autonomous robot I am working on called the Tawnamy Bot. The end-goal is to have both a simulated robot and a physical robot that can navigate and map it's surroundings.

The plan is to utilize the ROS2 Navigation2 stack and SLAM for autonomous navigation.

I am following various tutorials published by Josh Newans of Articulated Robotics to get an idea of how to create the initial robot. As such this will largely be similar to his robot in the beginning, but as time goes on it will deviate as I work towards my own autonomous robot implementation
